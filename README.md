# python-learning-journal
a repository to document my Python learning journey
My name is Shaarav Naik. I'm a 10th grader at Leigh High School. I want to try and pursue a degree in programming. I've recently started to learn Python, and I hope to further my skills with this course.
I want to try and become well versed in advanced Python concepts, such as data structures, among others.
By the end of this course, I want to have gained valuble skills and knowledge to prepare me for the next steps in my programming journey.
